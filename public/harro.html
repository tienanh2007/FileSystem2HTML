<h1>Research</h1>
<p>
My lab develops optical spectroscopic and imaging methods to quantify
 physiological, structural and metabolic properties of biological tissues
  in living organisms ranging from humans through mice. Applications of these
  tools include detection of cancer, providing early indicators of therapeutic
  progress on a per-individual basis during conventional anti-cancer treatments,
   imaging blood flow to detect peripheral artery disease or hemorrhage, and
   assessing brain activity during cognitive tasks. Much of this research is
   highly inter-disciplinary and brings the power of optical spectroscopy for
   biomedical sensing. The fundamental motivation behind this work is to
   non-invasively observe, model and understand how physics makes biology
   work.
</p>

<span>My research interests span three realms:</span>
<h2>1) Instrumentation development for optical sensing</h2>
<p>
Experimental implementations of optical techniques can be exquisitely complex
 or quite basic, depending on the desired outcomes or needs. Simple optical
 spectroscopic systems for routine monitoring of tissue physiology at patient
 bedside can be assembled with small form-factors for under $5000 using
 commercially available off-the-shelf light sources and detectors. Innovations
 in the semi-conductor and optical communication industries might facilitate
 building devices that would be yet more sensitive while having even more
 smaller foot-prints, allowing optical biomedical imaging to be performed at
 several different spatial and/or temporal scales. My goals are to improve the
 existing platform of optical methods to increase resolution and performance
 while in parallel, build cost-effective, simple and self-contained optical
spectroscopic tools particularly for global health applications in cancer.

<h4><b><u>Ongoing projects include:</u></b></h4>
<ul>
<li>Imaging diffuse reflectance using an iPhone</li>
<li>Wide-field laser speckle imaging for measuring blood flow</li>
<li>Fiber-optic based sensing of blood flow via diffuse correlation spectroscopy</li>
<li>Development of a low-cost autocorrelator using a Raspberry-Pi</li>
<li>Combined fiber-optic sensor for diffuse reflectance and fluorescence spectroscopy of tissues</li>
</ul>
<h2>2) Applications of optical methods in human or animal studies</h2>
<p>In cancer biology, the tumor microenvironment – specifically when cast in
terms of its vascular network and oxygenation status - is known to modulate
cancer growth as well as its response to administered treatments. As oxygen
bound hemoglobin has a distinct intrinsic optical absorption spectrum, optical
spectroscopy of tissue can directly sense blood oxygenation and tissue
hemoglobin concentration. A couple of factors allow for the routine use of these
 measurements in clinical and pre-clinical studies to monitor solid tumors in
 their native environments or states.

First, these measurements can be obtained quickly and easily by delivering and
collecting light from tissue via thin, flexible fiber-optic probes. Second,
they can be done without need for exogenous contrast, and finally they are
virtually painless. I intend to continue my study of tumor biology using
optical methods to measure longitudinal changes of physiological endpoints
to determine whether they can isolate early predictors of treatment outcome.</p>
<h2>3) Quantitative theoretical and computational tools for optical imaging and spectroscopy</h2>
<p>The effect of light scattering in biological media leads to problems with
direct optical imaging and with Beer’s law based approaches for estimation of
tissue chromophore or fluorophore concentrations. Theoretical and numerical
models of light transport in turbid media are typically implemented as
“forward” solutions, meaning that given the optical and structural properties
of the tissue, these models can accurately compute the signals at specified
detectors. In practice, however, it is necessary to solve the “inverse” problem,
 i.e. given measured signals at specific source-detector configurations, the
 tissue optical and structural properties need to be determined. My goals are
 to advance theoretical and computational light transport methods and models
 while simultaneously optimize their applications in inverse problems to best
 quantify tissue optical properties and structure.</p>
