    	I completed my bachelor's degree in Physics and Mathematics in 1997 from <a href="http://www.sjc.ac.in/" name="SJIC">St. Josephs College</a>, Bangalore, India. Since I was quite attracted to computing and learning about computing, I landed a job with <a href="http://www.wipro.com/" name="Wipro">WIPRO Systems Inc</a>. After a brief sojourn of 6 months on the corporate "bench", life inside a software company was not as I'd imagined. I joined <a href="https://www.ncbs.res.in/faculty/bhalla">Dr. Upi Bhalla's group</a> as a junior research fellow at the <a href="https://www.ncbs.res.in/">National Center for Biological Sciences</a> in 1998. I decided to move to the United States to seek a graduate degree in Physics looking for research project with computational emphasis and addressing biological problems. </p>
    	<p>I received a MS in Physics from <a href="http://physics.dartmouth.edu/">Dartmouth College</a> in 2003 and completed my Ph.D from the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/appliedphysics">University of Michigan</a> with <a href="http://bme.umich.edu/people/mary-ann-mycek/">Dr. Mary-Ann Mycek</a> in 2005. I held post-doctoral research positions at Michigan till 2006 and then at <a href="http://bme.duke.edu/">Duke</a> till 2012. I joined the Optics and Photonics staff at <a href="http://rmdinc.com/">Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc.</a> as a senior research scientist in 2012 till I found my position at Miami University in 2014. </p>
    	<p>I direct the <strong>OSIM lab</strong> here where we explore the use of optics to understand and solve biomedical problems. I like working with students and researchers across disciplinary boundaries toward applying science and technology for improving quality of human life.

    My name is Anthony Young, and I am a fourth-year student at Miami. I am completing a
combined Bachelor’s/Master’s degree program in the Physics Department. I have been working in the
OSIM lab with Dr. Vishwanath since the fall of 2014. Performing research has allowed me to explore
scientific phenomena that I would not have been able to in a classroom setting. In the lab, I get to work
alongside others who possess similar interests and offer strong encouragement. I am studying the
applicability of laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI), a non-invasive, optical technique, to measure
superficial blood flow in biological tissue. I have had the opportunity to present my research on LSCI at
Miami’s Undergraduate Research Forum, the 2015 OSAPS annual meeting in Cleveland, and the 2016
SPIE Photonics West conference in San Francisco. My current project is to investigate a technique
capable of completing LSCI flow measurements using multiple wavelengths of light simultaneously.</p>

    My name is Sara Zanfardino and I am a first year graduate student here at Miami
University. I also completed my Bachelor’s degree at Miami University where I majored
in Biochemistry and minored in Physics. My biochemistry background combined with
my desire to deepen my knowledge in physics is what led me to the Optical Spectroscopy
and Imaging in Medicine (OSIM) lab here, concentrating on biomedical applications of
physics using optical tools. My research in the OSIM lab is focused on Diffuse
Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS). I investigate how blood flow parameters can be
determined by directing laser light onto a sample and then detecting the light after it has
‘diffused’ through the sample and monitoring induced or naturally occurring changes.
In the future I plan to continue my education in physics and hopefully use it to increase
student interest in the vastly emerging field.</p>

    In OSIM Lab, I work with Dr. Vishwanath and Vinoin Vincely on testing whether it is
possible to obtain a person’s heart-rate using only a video of them. One major challenge we have
been facing on this project is subject movement. As the person being filmed moves, our methods
generally produce poorer results than if they were motionless. The main goal of this project is to
be able to extract accurate heart-rates from all subjects – even moving ones. Doing this would
have numerous potential applications ranging from remote healthcare to psychological
experiments.
I joined OSIM in May 2016, and my time here has been positive in every way. Since
most of the lab groups are small, there is always an opportunity to get some valuable, hands-on
experience learning how “real-world” science is done. One of my favorite things about OSIM is
that it is open to all students – not just graduate students and upperclassmen. The work I hope to
continue working with OSIM for many semesters to come.</p>

My name is Vinoin Devpaul Vincely, a senior biophysics major at Miami University. I had initially started
working in the OSIM lab on the project “On the possibility of extracting a heart rate taken with a
consumer camera” with Adam Eaton at the fall of 2015. I am currently working on “Time-resolved
diffuse spectroscopy”, which includes extracting optical properties of substances using an integrating
sphere setup and some computational tools. I am working on this project with Jijun Chen. I was curious
to explore the diverse ways one can use physical concepts such as imaging and spectroscopy to better
the healthcare industry. This is what lead me to work in an optics lab such as the OSIM lab. Through my
time in the OSIM lab, I have gained valuable insights in working with different people with different and
unique views while gaining a stronger grasp on core concepts fundamental to the field of optics and
imaging. Moreover, I constantly find myself appreciating the physical concepts behind various
phenomenon that I observe while working in the lab.
