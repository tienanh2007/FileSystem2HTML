    <h3>Vinoin Devpaul Vincely</h3>
    <p>My name is Vinoin Devpaul Vincely and I have been a part of Pr. Vishwnath's
      lab for over a year. I am an international student from India and wanted to
      study in the U.S. ever since high school. I am working with him on the project
      titled "On the possibility of extracting a heart rate from a video taken with
      a consumer camera". I am a biophysics major and enjoy learning new things.
      This is what drove me to take part in this project and see if something as
      minute as heart rate can be accurately determined by using a regular smartphone.
      I enjoy working with others and have a great time doing something I enjoy.</p>

    <h3>Sara Zanfardino</h3>
    <p>My name is Sara Zanfardino and I am a first year graduate student here at Miami
University. I also completed my Bachelor’s degree at Miami University where I majored
in Biochemistry and minored in Physics. My biochemistry background combined with
my desire to deepen my knowledge in physics is what led me to the Optical Spectroscopy
and Imaging in Medicine (OSIM) lab here, concentrating on biomedical applications of
physics using optical tools. My research in the OSIM lab is focused on Diffuse
Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS). I investigate how blood flow parameters can be
determined by directing laser light onto a sample and then detecting the light after it has
‘diffused’ through the sample and monitoring induced or naturally occurring changes.
In the future I plan to continue my education in physics and hopefully use it to increase
student interest in the vastly emerging field.</p>

    <h3>Adam Eaton</h3>
    <p>In OSIM Lab, I work with Dr. Vishwanath and Vinoin Vincely on testing whether it is
possible to obtain a person’s heart-rate using only a video of them. One major challenge we have
been facing on this project is subject movement. As the person being filmed moves, our methods
generally produce poorer results than if they were motionless. The main goal of this project is to
be able to extract accurate heart-rates from all subjects – even moving ones. Doing this would
have numerous potential applications ranging from remote healthcare to psychological
experiments.
I joined OSIM in May 2016, and my time here has been positive in every way. Since
most of the lab groups are small, there is always an opportunity to get some valuable, hands-on
experience learning how “real-world” science is done. One of my favorite things about OSIM is
that it is open to all students – not just graduate students and upperclassmen. The work I hope to
continue working with OSIM for many semesters to come.</p>

    <h3>Anthony Young</h3>
    <p>My name is Anthony Young, and I am a fourth-year student at Miami. I am completing a
combined Bachelor’s/Master’s degree program in the Physics Department. I have been working in the
OSIM lab with Dr. Vishwanath since the fall of 2014. Performing research has allowed me to explore
scientific phenomena that I would not have been able to in a classroom setting. In the lab, I get to work
alongside others who possess similar interests and offer strong encouragement. I am studying the
applicability of laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI), a non-invasive, optical technique, to measure
superficial blood flow in biological tissue. I have had the opportunity to present my research on LSCI at
Miami’s Undergraduate Research Forum, the 2015 OSAPS annual meeting in Cleveland, and the 2016
SPIE Photonics West conference in San Francisco. My current project is to investigate a technique
capable of completing LSCI flow measurements using multiple wavelengths of light simultaneously.</p>

    <h3>Lindsay Darkins</h3>
    <p>I am a senior Biophysics major and I have worked with Dr. Vishwanath’s
      group since I was a sophomore. As a pre-medical student, I was excited to
       get involved with a group conducting research with real-life applications
        in the medical field. My research has been focused on developing a
         diffuse reflectance spectroscopy system, which allows us to determine
         optical properties of tissue with the aid of an inverse Monte Carlo
          model. The goal is to develop a non-invasive, non-destructive method
          for determining metabolic, oxygenation, and blood flow information
          using only light. For my current project, I am analyzing measurements
           taken in collaboration with a group at Cincinnati Children’s that is
           exploring the evolution of stroke in a mouse model. Getting involved
           in research is one of the best experiences I have had as an
           undergraduate. With this lab, I have had the opportunity to design
            and conduct experiments on my own, travel and present my research
             at a regional conference, and obtain research experience that
             students in larger departments may not see until they reach the
             graduate level. Please feel free to email me at
             darkinlm@miamioh.edu if you have any questions about working
             in Dr. Vishwanath’s lab or about undergraduate research in the
             Physics Department in general.</p>
