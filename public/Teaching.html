<div class="pagesubsections">PHY 161/162: Physics for the life sciences </div> 
<section>
PHY 161 and 162 are the first and second part of the two-semester introduction to foundational topics in physics. These classes are pre-requisites for most biology and biochemical majors, including premedical studies. Topics covered range from concepts of scalars and vectors, motion in 1D and 2D, Newton’s laws, ideas of energy and momentum, physical conservation laws, oscillations, waves, thermodynamics (temperature, kinetic theory of gases, the laws of thermodynamics, heat engines), electromagnetism (theory of electric and magnetic fields, direct current circuits, electromagnetic waves), optics (light propagation, mirrors and lenses, interference and diffraction of light) and basic atomic/nuclear physics. Qualitative reasoning will be emphasized along the development of basic quantitative problem-solving skills.
<br>
The PHY161/162 sequence seeks to underscore physical reasoning behind observed phenomena
along with the mathematical techniques used to quantify these observations. The application and impact of the
ideas developed here on other various disciplines including chemistry, biology, medical and/or social sciences
will be highlighted. Upon completing this course it is expected you will have an appreciation of the core principles that describe a variety of different physical phenomena (such as thermal expansion, nature of electricity, magnetic substances and electromagnetic waves) along applications of these principles in construction of several commonplace devices (such as thermometers, electro-cardiograms(ECG), cameras, microscopes, MR/PET scanners, sphygmomanometers, radios, cellular phones etc.)

<div class="pagesubsections">PHY 286: Introduction to Computational Physics </div> 
<section>
This course introduces basic techniques of computational analysis for solving a variety of mathematical problems encountered in physics and engineering. Topics will range through root finding for polynomial and transcendental equations, numerical differentiation and integration, finding numerical solutions for ordinary and partial differential equations and scientific visualization techniques. Examples will include standard physics problems from classical mechanics, E&M, quantum mechanics, statistical physics and/or biological physics. Particular emphasis will be placed on problems which cannot be solved analytically. The course will also introduce the concept of stochastic processes via examinations of chaotic behavior that emerges in several different dynamical systems. Particular emphasis will be placed on problems that cannot (or are quite difficult to) be solved analytically (i.e. “by hand”).
<br>
The course uses MATLAB as the sandbox to learn and use computational methods. At the end of this course it is expected that you will be able to fluently read, interpret and debug basic MATLAB code and use MATLAB to analyze physics problems. You will be able to use computational tools to solve many physics problems
and develop skills to derive, inspect and/or visualize code. These will be skills you can use for various things outside this course.

<div class="pagesubsections">PHY 430: Special topics: Optical sensing in Biological Physics (with Dr. Paul Urayama) </div> 
<section>
This is a new lecture-laboratory course for biological physics majors. The course emphasizes the use of non-invasive optical imaging and spectroscopy for investigating a range of biophysical phenomena. Applications of optical techniques for scales ranging from molecules to tissue are introduced.  Topics covered include molecular-folding transitions, protein binding with a focus on the optical discrimination of ligand conformations, optical sensing of cellular metabolism, imaging and spectroscopy in turbid tissues including laser speckle flow imaging and diffuse tissue optical spectroscopy.Theoretical concepts in tissue optics, light absorption and scattering, geometrical and physical optics will be covered.
</section>

<div class="pagesubsections">PHY 437/537: Introduction to Thermodynamics and Statistical Physics </div> 
<section>
The goal of this course is to use mathematical ideas of probability and statistics to formulate a physical framework that can serve to explain the laws of thermodynamics. The course will present an overview of historical ideas and principles that were established in thermodynamics (zeroth, first, second and third laws; energy potentials) and make connections (simultaneously or sequentially) to thermodynamic ideas through formal mathematical approaches using statistical mechanics. Applications of statistical techniques to treat thermodynamic problems in astrophysics, cosmology, optics, atmospheric sciences and/or biology will be illustrated. At the end of this course, it is expected that you will be well positioned for pursuing research and graduate level course- work in statistical mechanics. 
<br>
Topics covered will include state functions, differential relations between thermodynamic free-energies; ensemble formalism and use of statistical mechanics to “derive” thermodynamic laws; formalism of classical and quantum statistical mechanics; computational and numerical methods to describe statistics of macroscopic systems. Examples will be drawn from contemporary research in statistical mechanics. The course will provide some insights into the physical laws that emerge as behavior of thermodynamics/thermal systems and seek to develop advanced mathematical techniques for treating such problems.
